KEY REMAPPER - USER INSTRUCTIONS
========================================

WHAT YOU RECEIVED:
------------------
A folder with the Key Remapper program files.

HOW TO USE IT:
--------------

STEP 1: Run the Program
   - Double-click "RUN.bat" in the folder
   - The first time: It will automatically build the program (takes 1-2 minutes)
   - After that: It will launch instantly
   - If Windows shows a warning, click "More info" then "Run anyway"
     (This is normal for programs that aren't digitally signed)
   
   NOTE: You need Python installed. If you don't have it, the program will tell you.

STEP 2: Set Up Your First Key Remapping
   - Click the "+ Add Remapping" button at the top
   - In the new row that appears:
     * Click "Set Key" and press the key you want to remap (e.g., press "A")
     * Click "Add" and press keys you want as replacements (e.g., press "W", then "E")
       (You can add multiple target keys - the program will randomly pick one)

STEP 3: Add More Remappings (Optional)
   - Click "+ Add Remapping" again to add another key remapping
   - Repeat Step 2 for each additional key you want to remap

STEP 4: Start the Remapping
   - Click "Start Remapping" button
   - The status will change to "Active"
   - Now when you press your source keys, they will randomly output the target keys!

STEP 5: Stop When Done
   - Click "Stop Remapping" when you want to disable it

IMPORTANT NOTES:
----------------
- On Windows, you may need to RIGHT-CLICK the .exe file and select 
  "Run as administrator" for the key remapping to work properly
  
- The program must stay open while remapping is active
  
- To remove a remapping, click "Remove" in that row

EXAMPLE:
--------
If you want "A" to randomly type "W" or "E":
1. Click "+ Add Remapping"
2. Click "Set Key" and press "A"
3. Click "Add" and press "W"
4. Click "Add" and press "E"
5. Click "Start Remapping"
6. Now when you press "A", it will randomly type "W" or "E" instead!

TROUBLESHOOTING:
---------------
- Keys not remapping? Try running as Administrator (right-click → Run as administrator)
- Program won't start? Your antivirus might be blocking it (it's safe, just a false positive)
- Need help? Contact the person who sent you this file
